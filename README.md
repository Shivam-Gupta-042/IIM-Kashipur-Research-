Literature Review on AI, Gamification, and Consumer Behaviour
🔍 Project Overview

This project presents a literature review on the interaction of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Gamification as forces shaping consumer behaviour and digital marketing strategies. The review draws upon two major psychological theories:

Self-Determination Theory (SDT)

Elaboration Likelihood Model (ELM)

To synthesize insights, Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) topic modelling was applied on two literature streams:

200 studies related to SDT

286 studies related to ELM

🧠 Theoretical Framework

The analysis integrates SDT and ELM in the context of digital marketing, uncovering how AI and gamification influence persuasion and engagement.

From the LDA results, a framework named AMMO was proposed, which highlights four theoretical antecedents:

Engagement by Smart Technology

Strategic Information Architecture

Autonomy Protection

Network Intelligence

🔗 Connections & Outcomes

The study explores the connections between mediating and moderating variables, leading to key outcome variables such as:

Interactive Influence

Responsive Consumer Solutions

This bridges psychological needs satisfaction with persuasion processing routes, showing how AI + Gamification impact consumer decision-making.

🎯 Contribution
